# Adirtha Borgohain - Personal Portfolio

This repository contains the source code for my personal one-page portfolio website. It is built from scratch using Jekyll, designed to be minimalist, monochrome, and easily maintainable. The entire site is data-driven, meaning content updates can be made by editing simple YAML files without touching the HTML.

## ‚úçÔ∏è How to Update Content

The biggest advantage of this portfolio is that you almost never need to touch the HTML. All content is managed in configuration (`_config.yml`) or data (`_data/*.yml`) files.

### Main Configuration

-   **File to Edit:** `_config.yml`
-   **What to change:** Your `name`, `job_title`, `email`, `description`, and social media usernames (`github_username`, `linkedin_username`).

### About Section & Skills

-   **Your Photo:** Replace the image at `assets/images/adirtha.jpg` with your own.
-   **Your Skills:** Edit the file `_data/skills.yml`. You can add or remove categories and items by following the existing format:
    ```yml
    - category: Category Name
      items:
        - Skill 1
        - Skill 2
    ```

### Experience Section

-   **File to Edit:** `_data/experience.yml`
-   To add a new job, simply copy an existing entry and paste it at the top of the list. Then, fill in the details.
    ```yml
    - company: New Company Inc.
      company_url: https://newcompany.com
      location: City, Country
      title: Your New Title
      duration: Month Year ‚Äì Present

        - "Responsibility two."
    ```

### Projects Section

-   **File to Edit:** `_data/projects.yml`
-   There are two types of projects: **featured** and **regular**.

-   **To add a new Featured Project:**
    -   Add an entry with `featured: true`.
    -   Make sure to add a screenshot to `assets/images/`.

      github_url: https://github.com/user/repo # Optional

      featured: true
    ```

-   **To add a new Regular Project (GitHub Repo):**
    -   Add an entry with `featured: false` or omit the featured flag.
