Hi! üëãüèº I am Adirtha. As an experienced problem-solver, I have spent my career seeking answers to the most challenging and pressing questions. Driven by my insatiable curiosity, I am deeply passionate about all things tech-related and enjoy working with a variety of tools and frameworks.

Currently serving as a <strong> Data Scientist</strong> at <a href="https://inveniai.com/">InveniAI</a>, I bring a wealth of experience and demonstrated expertise in Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing. Over the years, I have honed my skills in working with a diverse range of tools and frameworks, including Kafka, Elasticsearch, Fastapi, Transformers, Keras, and TensorFlow. My primary programming language is Python, although I am also quick to pick up other languages as needed.

Throughout my career, I have held roles at leading organizations such as Netenrich, Threatlandscape, Geminid Systems, and Snehalaya, where I leveraged my skills in data science, machine learning, software development, and social research to drive positive change.

I am someone who is deeply passionate about solving complex problems and staying up-to-date with the latest trends and technologies. If you are interested to know more or have any queries, please feel free to reach out. Thank you!
